# MultiBoardTone
Arduino Library that allows you to run TONE regardless of which Arduino board you have!
The existing examples of how to generate a tone on arduino varies depending which board you have. 
MultiBoardTone allows you to choose a function depending which board you have.
I found trying to run the normal tone function on Due boards failed and there is a seperate version for Due
I combined the 2 into 2 seperate functions so they you dont have to have 2 verions of sketches because you use different boards
